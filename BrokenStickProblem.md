Broken Stick Problem
================

Problem
-------

> A stick of length 1 is broken at a uniformly random point, yielding two pieces. Let X and Y be the lengths of the shorter and longer pieces, respectively, and let R = X=Y be the ratio of the lengths of X and Y.
>
> 1.  Find the CDF and PDF of R.
> 2.  Find the expected value of R (if it exists).
> 3.  Find the expected value of 1/R (if it exists).
